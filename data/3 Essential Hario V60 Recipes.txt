in this video we picked three hario v60 recipes that we believe give you a solid framework for improving your poor over coffee game we picked recipes developed by james hoffman tetsu kasuya and method called osmotic flow for each method we will give a little insight into its origin and main brewing approach then we will take you step by step through proving coffee using this recipe and at the end we will taste and compare different results unfortunately there is not a single best recipe the ultimate one that would work for everyone but we hope this video will help you to pick or create your favorite v60 method let's start with james hoffman's recipe he presented his ultimate v60 coffee technique back in 2019 i use it in different variations and came across this method in many coffee shops the brewing technique focuses on small number of pores and increase extraction by using finer grind size and increased agitation so let's try it let's prove james hoffman recipe first we will prepare our filter and wash it with hot or even boiling water if you have a plastic v60 it's not that important to have it hot but if you have ceramic v60 the boiling water is better because it gets your dripper heated properly okay we are gonna use 18 grams of coffee grind on commandante 21 clicks even the bed and now make a little well in the coffee grounds this is so the water gets absorbs faster and more evenly into the coffee now we can start we'll pour 45 grams of water usually james recommends to use two to three times the weight of the coffee and straight after pouring mix all coffee grounds until they are even don't worry to give it a proper stir and now we wait 45 seconds the pre-infusion phase is for all the co2 to escape the coffee so we can extract more flavors and it's especially important because now we have quite fine grind so it helps to escape faster now the first pour it's 60 of our total volume and that's up to 180 grams we should pour this in about 20 seconds this is for you to imagine the speed of the pouring so you don't pour too fast or too slow which would create different agitation and different brew time in the end the second pour it's coming in few seconds after the slurry comes down and this one which is 120 grams of water will be up to 300 grams it will also take around 80 seconds so it's almost the same speed perhaps just slightly slower now we mixed with spoon the wife to the right one time this is to get all the coarse particles from the sides to sink to the bottom and straight after that we can give it a gentle swirl three four times to get all the coffee concentrated on the bottom of the dripper so it gets extracted more evenly then you wait and draw down and the whole brewing time should be around three minutes i think this is the smallest amount of the coffee that you can use for this recipe and perhaps it's even easier to use large amounts for this method for like 24 30 grams so after the brewing as you can see when the all the water leaves the coffee bed we should have even leveled coffee bed where all the coffee is concentrated on the bottom and there are not large particles on the sides so everything was on one place and the water flew through it evenly and there is our coffee the four to six method is created by tetsu kasuya a japanese world brewers cup champion his method is called four to six because that is how you divide the total pours the first forty percent influences the level of acidity and sweetness and the remaining 60 controls the strength of the coffee i really wanted to include tattoo because his brewing recipe was a big inspiration to me he did amazing job presenting how you can influence the flavors of your coffee through the brewing process we will move to the second recipe of tetsuka from japan so first the same like the first method we'll always preheat and rinse the filter with hot water to get rid of that papery taste paper filters are topic by itself but we are not getting into that today we are using 18 grams of coffee again but now it's a coarser grind this is 23 clicks with commandante so the first part 110 grams is divided in two pours for the blooming 45 grams and we will wait 45 seconds we'll wait 45 seconds at each pour not on in the blooming phase but each pour will take 45 seconds so all you have to do is just pour the water and wait 45 seconds there is no agitation in this method only waiting the second pour will be up to 120 grams this is tetsu's principle to divide the whole brew to first 40 percent and then to 60 percent so for this coffee for this kenyan coffee we chose uh to have smaller first pour to highlight the sweetness of it because there is plenty of acidity and we want to balance it with nice weakness now the draw down until one and half minute and then the second then sorry then the third fourth and fifth pour will be all by 60 grams so we'll pour now up to 180 grams with right we we try to pour on the coffee so you will avoid the walls of the filter and always try to go from the middle up to the to the walls 2 15 and the next pour will be up to 240 grams from the middle and slowly circles towards the edges tetsu is a really cool guy and a brewer and you can find experiments that he does on his instagram or social media he's using different very old japanese methods and this is a combination of few of these methods but what i like is how beautifully divided and easy this brew method is the last pour at 3 minutes is up to 300 grams the pouring speed is medium so as you could see when all the water is out through the coffee bed we always pour to the same level like we poured the first first pour so we are not increasing the level of the coffee total time should be between three and a half and four minutes okay now as you can see we have the coffee coffee is ready and if you can see we have a different coffee bed than with the first method so what's the difference is that we keep the level of the water quite low the coffee bed should be flat and there could be some of the coffee particles on the side of the filter usually the level of the coffee for this recipe is about two centimeters above the level of the coffee bed there you go the last method is called osmotic flow and was made popular by japanese company called kafek they are known for producing high quality coffee filters however this style of slow brewing is not completely new and has long history in japan this method calls for a very gentle and slow pouring over a very small surface of a coffee bed the goal is very low agitation during pouring honestly it's very different method to any other we use and we are really curious to give it a try so the third method osmotic flow again oh this is too boring to repeat but we're gonna rinse that paper filter osmotic flow works in completely different principles and way than our first method so it's gonna be really interesting to try and taste it we are using 18 grams of coffee that's grind really coarse like a french press this is 30 clicks on commandante first pour is going to be 45 grams and in this method during whole pouring is very important to pour slowly we will let it bloom for 40 seconds and now we will do central pour slowly into the middle until the coffee bed lift itself and then we stop we'll just do a few pulses until we reach the half of the total brew cafe that created this method or that promoted this method cafe recommends to do one third of the poor but i find it better and easier to go to the half of the total bro volume okay after letting the coffee bed breathe we're gonna do small continuous pour draw a small circle and when the coffee bed starts to raise we'll give it a break again and continue just doing the same until we reach 300 in the end of the brewing perhaps last 10 percent we increase drawing the circle all the way to the edges and do a quick last pour to get the coffee finally submerged into the water the whole brewing time should be between 3 to four minutes so don't be afraid to do more slower pours now it's going to be our last pour so from the center quickly to the edges and finish we're finished 3 minutes and 25 seconds as you can see this is again totally different bed which is pretty cool that you can play with these methods and get totally different results so have a look the coffee bed it's almost on the same level so the water didn't raise the the coffee and it stayed in the middle and we were pouring only through the center that should be drawing all the flavors from around this is osmotic method and now let's try now that we brewed all three recipes we're gonna look at their differences let's start with the james method it produced really balanced cap with a round body and lively acidity after that was long and very sweet which complemented the juiciness of this cayenne coffee what i liked about this recipe is that you extract a lot of the coffee and its sweetness it's very pleasant but you have to be also careful if you overdo the agitation phase you will get dry and astringent aftertaste in your brew easily also i reckon it would be more suitable method for dense lighter roasted coffees because that's where we want the extraction to be really high the second method was tetsu recipe it created really crispy acidity very clean taste and layered structure in the flavors i liked that the juiciness of this kenyan coffee was bursting at you and it was super clean and very pleasant actually i think that tetsu method is great to play with to learn how brewing or pouring influences the flavor of the coffee you can easily adjust for more fruity or sweeter cup as well as understand and change the strain and body of the brew i also like the juicy and clean taste it produced and it's relatively easy to replicate and the last method osmotic flow the flavor is different to the other two brews a lot it's milder or softer and acidity is muted while in after days i got a lot of time hint of bitterness what is interesting and what i like the most is the body and the viscosity of the brew and most of the time it produces really syrupy texture osmotic flow is something cool to try if you want to experience a metal that creates really different cup of coffee that you are used to and you have pouring kettle that allows you to pour slowly and gently you should give it a go also i have not tested darkeros as i am not fan of them but that's where it could produce better results and i will definitely try it in the future so what is the main takeaway from this video there is another perfect method that is universal for all the coffees these three techniques should give you a great foundation for creating your own proper recipe now it's your turn to have fun while brewing a cup of coffee and don't be afraid to experiment enjoy your coffee and see you next time
